    <h2>About croissant</h2>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.
      <br />
      <br />
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stories of how the Kipferl — and so, ultimately, the croissant — was
      created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to the
      19th century. However, there are no contemporary sources for any of these
      stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not mention the
      Kipferl in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods.
